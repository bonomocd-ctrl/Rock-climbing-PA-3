    steps:
    # Step 1: Checkout the code from the repository
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Step 2: Set up C++ environment (install g++ and cmake)
    - name: Set up C++ environment

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y g++ cmake

    # Step 3: Install Doctest
    - name: Install doctest
      run: |
        git clone https://github.com/onqtam/doctest.git
        cd doctest && mkdir build && cd build

    # Step 4: Create a build directory and run cmake to configure the project
    - name: Build the project
      run: |
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..

    # Step 5: Run unit tests using doctest
    - name: Run unit tests with doctest
      run: |
        cd build
        ./your_program_executable --doctest  # Replace 'your_program_executable' with your actual executable name

    # Step 6: Optional - Upload test results or artifacts (for later analysis)
    - name: Upload test results
      if: failure()  # This will only upload if the tests fail
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
